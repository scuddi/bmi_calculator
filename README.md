This is my bmi_calculator. At the moment V_01 is published with basic functions of a BMI Calculator, so weight and height can be entered in the terminal and the result will be printed.

V_02 is in Work

ToDos / Planned functions for the future:
  - Basic GUI with tkinter or another program
  - maybe adding the age aspect into the calculator
