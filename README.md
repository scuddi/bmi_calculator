# BMI GUI Calculator

❗ **This is my second python project ever** ❗

Welcome to BMI-Calculator. 

At the moment V_01 is published with basic functions of a BMI Calculator, so weight and height can be entered in the terminal and the result will be printed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is currently under construction, so that anyone interested can test it out. Therefore I am going to change the structure of the repo.
>
> The goal is to dockerise every version of the calculator so it will run on your machine too 👍
